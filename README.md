User will be able to Pause and Rewind the .mp3 file to beginning of the sound being played. The Stop button will terminate the music player session and user will need to open a new .mp3 file to start playing a song.

Additionally, the volume can be adjusted with the use of a scrollbar. The default volume is set at 70%.

Feel free to use the source code to play some of your favourite songs!
